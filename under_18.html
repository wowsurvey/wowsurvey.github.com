      <h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>
      <p>I understand that my child will be asked to participate in an online survey research study on the social interaction patterns and preferences of MMORPG players. If your child is currently a resident of the United States of America and plays one or more MMORPGs, your child is eligible to participate. Your child will be asked to complete a 5-10 minute survey. Your child will not be paid or reimbursed for their participation.</p>
      <h3>RISKS AND BENEFITS:</h3>
      <p> The risks associated with this survey study are minimal, and are comparable to the risks involved with casual web browsing.  The benefits that may reasonably be expected to result from this study are empirical findings that would enhance the understanding of the social interaction patterns and preferences of MMORPG players.</p>
      <h3>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</h3>
      <p>Your participation in this study will take approximately 5-10 minutes.</p>
      <h3>CONFIDENTIALITY:</h3> 
      <p>All efforts, within reason, will be made to keep the personal information in your research record private, but total privacy cannot be promised.  Your information may be shared with Middle Tennessee State University or the government, such as MTSU Institutional Review Board and the Federal Government Office for Human Research Protections.</p>
      <h3>SUBJECT&#39;S RIGHTS:</h3>
      <p>I understand that my child&#39;s participation is voluntary and that he/she has the right to withdraw their consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty.  I understand that my child has the right to refuse to answer particular questions. I also understand that his/her individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study.</p>
